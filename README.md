# Machine Learning Projects & Resources

This repository contains all the materials related to my studies and hands-on projects in Machine Learning and Data Mining. It includes both reference resources and applied projects.

## Structure

- `projects/` – Contains individual machine learning projects with real-world data and models.
- `resources/` – Includes notebooks and materials from IBM course, along with personal study notes.

## Projects

Here are some of the main projects in this repository:

- [House Price Prediction in Tehran](projects/house-price-predictor-tehran)  
  Predicts real estate prices in Tehran using regression models and data preprocessing.

## Resources

Resources used for learning and reference:
- TU Darmstadt ML course materials
- Personal notes and cleaned datasets
- Notebooks on concepts like likelihood, overfitting, and cross-validation
- [Maktabkhune ML Course](https://maktabkhooneh.org/course/%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B4%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%BE%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86-mk1318/)
